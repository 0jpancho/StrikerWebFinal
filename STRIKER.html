        <p>
            Striker 101 is the team name and number of our School's FRC team (FIRST Robotics Competition). We have been a part of FRC since 1989. That means we are one of the oldest teams around. our team number really shows how long we have been a part of it and how dedicted we have been to the program. Teams who are joining just now have team numbers up into the 5,000 numbers. Our mentors are very dedicated to our cause and are trying to help us build on our long history.
